# tableau-notes

# reminders when importing data for first time
- ensure fields are correctly categorized (dimension vs measure)
- **optional** filter rows

# rules for views
- use color & size (not numbers) to drive visualizations
- use colors that cater to color-blind people: orange/blue
- always sort your data, unless you are working with dates
- always use date fields as columns, never as rows
- just because a view is not visually appealing is not a reason to change it - the fact that there is no clear pattern is a powerful insight, don't try to skew the visualization to make it what it's not - keep it real

# rules for dashboards
- 3 key components: content, layout, interactivity
- the brain works best with 4 views, try not to exceed that
- remember which direction audience will read (for english: left to right, top to bottom)
- start with simplest view and get more detailed/advanced
- remove clutter

# rules for stories
- plan:
  - create problem statement
  - pick fields
  - plan layout
- don't try to plan the outcome, what matters is the insights
- guide interactivity but don't lock the user in, maintain their freedom
