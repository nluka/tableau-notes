# tableau-notes

# reminders when importing data for first time
- ensure fields are correctly categorized (dimension vs measure)
- **optional** filter rows

# rules for views
- use color & size (not numbers) to drive visualizations
- always sort your data, unless you are working with dates
- always use date fields as columns, never as rows

# rules for dashboards
- 3 key components: content, layout, interactivity
- the brain works best with 4 views, try not to exceed that
- remember which direction audience will read (for english: left to right, top to bottom)
- start with simplest view and get more detailed/advanced
- remove clutter
